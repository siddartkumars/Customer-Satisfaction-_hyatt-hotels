# Customer-Satisfaction-_HYATT-hotels
The object of the project is to analyze different business aspects for the hyatt group of hotels to improve their NPS (overall likelihood to recommend score ) to get more brand popularity and customer satisfaction.

Business Questions that were focused on the project

• How to improve the NPS score for hotels in USA?
• What are the services provided by a particular hotel that influence likelihood to recommend?
• Do most customers travel for business or leisure?
• Which state has the highest number of customers?
• Which regions in USA have highest number of promoters and detractors?


What is NPS score?
The Net Promoter Score is a loyalty metric developed by Fred Reichheld. It is used to
measure the loyalty between the provider and a consumer. The Net Promoter Score is
calculated based on responses to a single question: How likely is it that you would
recommend our company/ product/ service to a friend or colleague? The scoring for this
answer is most often based on a 0 to 10 scale. Those who respond with a score of 9 to
10 are called Promoters, and are considered likely to exhibit value-creating behaviors,
such as buying more, remaining customers for longer, and making more positive referrals
to other potential customers. Those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are labeled
Detractors, and they are believed to be less likely to exhibit the value-creating behaviors.
Responses of 7 and 8 are customers who are “passively satisfied” and their behavior falls
in the middle of Promoters and Detractors. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by
subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.
